# DeepLearning-Convolutional Neural Network-
I build a model that can predict the hand written numbers from 0-9 which gives 99% Accuracy!
I used Convolutional Neural Network which can classify the images, 
A convolution multiplies a matrix of pixels with a filter matrix or ‘kernel’ and sums up the multiplication values.
Then the convolution slides over to the next pixel and repeats the same process until all the image pixels have been covered
I build 8 layers for the HandWritten Dataset ; 2 Convolution layers , 2 Pooling layers , 1 Flatten and 3 Fully connected layers.
I showed in the code the correctly classified and Wrongly classified.
in the end i used Heatmap Confusion Matrix showing multi-class classification results.
